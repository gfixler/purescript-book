-- 1. (Easy) Test your understanding of the findEntry function by writing down
-- the types of each of its major subexpressions. For example, the type of the
-- head function as used is specialized to AddressBook -> Maybe Entry.

-- filterEntry :: Entry -> Boolean
-- filter :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) - List a -> List a
-- filter filterEntry :: List Entry -> List Entry
-- head :: forall a. List a -> List a
-- (<<<) :: forall b c d a. Semigroupoid a => a c d -> a b c -> a b d
-- head <<< filter filterEntry :: Entry
